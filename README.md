# bootlegger

A Node.js & Angular.js project used to complete a research project for the Newcastle University OpenLab.

It is an interface to Crowdflower (a crowdsourcing platform) and Bootlegger (a communnity video shoot program). It primarily allows for a set of video data to be broken down into segments. Jobs can then be created on Crowdflower to generate meta-data about these sets of video data.
