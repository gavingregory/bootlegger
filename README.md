# bootlegger

This project contains all of the source code for my Newcastle University dissertation project. It is an interface to Crowdflower (a crowdsourcing platform) and Bootlegger (a communnity video shoot program). It allows your video shoots to be browsed and for metadata to be generated on those shoots through crowdsourcing tasks.
